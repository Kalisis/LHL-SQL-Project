# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal with this project is to explore the data in this sample dataset and answer some questions. Obviously, the provided questions are a goal, but I'm also curious to explore the sentiment scores and see if I can learn anything about which products have the best reception, so I will be trying to look into that on my own.

## Process
### My first step was to create temporary versions of all of the tables, as the provided tables are incredibly messy. 
### My next step was to do some basic cleaning. I divided the unit prices by 1,000,000 to begin with, as well as changing the demo data error in all_sessions.city to "N/A".
